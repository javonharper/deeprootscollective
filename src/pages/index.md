  description: The Deep Roots Collective's mission is to facilitate the divestment
    of African descendent peoples from racist capitalist institutions and
    empower these communities to move toward self-sufficiency, healing and
    liberation. We do this through community programming that provides free

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
